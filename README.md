My first GitHub Pages Repository

Hello! 

I am here to learn more about how to use GitHub Pages so that I can create a website entry for my (435) Website Design Team (S | PS)
The topic being:
Develop a website to assist BPA chapters in planning their attendance at NLC in Orlando, FL May 4-8, 2021. Areas to be included, but not limited to: transportation methods (Metro, walking, bike share, Segway®, Uber®, Lyft®, taxi, pedicab, etc.), maps, hours of operation for local attractions & transportation, food, costs, local attractions security restrictions and specific guidelines, attire/dress code, etc.

Really am hoping this isn't too difficult as I am facing academic difficulties involving a lack of complete work...
If I were in a better position, a challenge isn't a bad thing and is very likely in the pursuit of learning something new. 
Things are going to get better soon.
                                                                                                                                                -Asu
