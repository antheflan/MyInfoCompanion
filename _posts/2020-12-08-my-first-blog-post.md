Three Ways of Meeting Oppression
by Martin Luther King, Jr., PhD
Oppressed people deal with their oppression in three characteristic ways. One way is
acquiescence: the oppressed resign themselves to their doom. They tacitly adjust themselves
to oppression, and thereby become conditioned to it. In every movement toward freedom
some of the oppressed prefer to remain oppressed. Almost 2800 years ago Moses set out to
lead the children of Israel from the slavery of Egypt to the freedom of the Promised Land. He
soon discovered that slaves do not always welcome their deliverers. They become
accustomed to being slaves. They would rather bear those ills they have, as Shakespeare
pointed out, than flee to others that they know not of. They prefer the “fleshpots of Egypt” to
the ordeals of emancipation.
There is such a thing as the freedom of exhaustion. Some people are so worn down by
the yoke of oppression that they give up. A few years ago in the slum areas of Atlanta, a
Negro guitarist used to sing almost daily: “Ben down so long that down don’t bother me.”
This is the type of negative freedom and resignation that often engulfs the life of the
oppressed.
But this is not the way out. To accept passively an unjust system is to cooperate with
that system; thereby the oppressed become as evil as the oppressor. Non-cooperation with
evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. The oppressed must never
allow the conscience of the oppressor to slumber. Religion reminds every man that he is his
brother’s keeper. To accept injustice or segregation passively is to say to the oppressor that
his actions are morally right. It is a way of allowing his con- science to fall asleep. At this
moment the oppressed fails to be his brother’s keeper. So acquiescence-while often the easier
way-is not the moral way. It is the way of the coward. The Negro cannot win the respect of
his oppressor by acquiescing; he merely increases the oppressor’s arrogance and contempt.
Acquiescence is interpreted as proof of the Negro’s inferiority. The Negro cannot win the
respect of the white people of the South or the peoples of the world if he is willing to sell the
future of his children for his personal and immediate comfort and safety.
A second way that oppressed people sometimes deal with oppression is to resort to
physical violence and corroding hatred. Violence often brings about momentary results.
Nations have frequently won their independence in battle. But in spite of temporary victories,
violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem; it merely creates new
and more complicated ones.
Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral. It is
impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. The old law of an
eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the
opponent rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert.
Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and
makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence

ends by defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers. A
voice echoes through time saying to every potential Peter, “Put up your sword.” History is
cluttered with the wreckage of nations that failed to follow his command.
If the American Negro and other victims of oppression succumb to the temptation of
using violence in the struggle for freedom, future generations will be the recipients of a
desolate night of bitterness, and our chief legacy to them will be an endless reign of
meaningless chaos. Violence is not the way.
The third way open to oppressed people in their quest for freedom is the way of
nonviolent resistance. Like the synthesis in Hegelian philosophy, the principle of nonviolent
resistance seeks to reconcile the truths of two opposites-acquiescence and violence-while
avoiding the extremes and immoralities of both. The nonviolent resister agrees with the
person who acquiesces that one should not be physically aggressive toward his opponent; but
he balances the equation by agreeing with the person of violence that evil must be resisted.
He avoids the nonresistance of the former and the violent resistance of the latter. With
nonviolent resistance, no individual or group need submit to any wrong, nor need anyone
resort to violence in order to right a wrong.
It seems to me that this is the method that must guide the actions of the Negro in the
present crisis in race relations. Through nonviolent resistance the Negro will be able to rise to
the noble height of opposing the unjust system while loving the perpetrators of the system.
The Negro must work passionately and unrelentingly for full stature as a citizen, but he must
not use inferior methods to gain it. He must never come to terms with falsehood, malice,
hate, or destruction.
Nonviolent resistance makes it possible for the Negro to remain in the South and
struggle for his rights. The Negro’s problem will not be solved by running away. He cannot
listen to the glib suggestion of those who would urge him to migrate en masse to other
sections of the country. By grasping his great opportunity in the South he can make a lasting
contribution to the moral strength of the nation and set a sublime example of courage for
generations yet unborn.
By nonviolent resistance, the Negro can also enlist all men of good will in his
struggle for equality. The problem is not a purely racial one, with Negroes set against whites.
In the end, it is not a struggle between people at all, but a tension between justice and
injustice. Nonviolent resistance is not aimed against oppressors but against oppression.
Under its banner consciences, not racial groups, are enlisted.
If the Negro is to achieve the goal of integration, he must organize himself into a
militant and nonviolent mass movement. All three elements are indispensable. The
movement for equality and justice can only be a success if it has both amass and militant
character; the barriers to be over- come require both. Nonviolence is an imperative in order to
bring about ultimate community.
A mass movement of militant quality that is not at the same time committed to
nonviolence tends to generate conflict, which in turn breeds anarchy. The support of the
participants and the sympathy of the uncommitted are both inhibited by the threat that
bloodshed will engulf the community. This reaction in turn encourages the opposition to
threaten and resort to force. When, however, the mass movement repudiates violence while
moving resolutely toward its goal, its opponents are revealed as the instigators and

practitioners of violence if it occurs. Then public support is magnetically attracted to the
advocates of nonviolence, while those who employ violence are literally disarmed by
overwhelming sentiment against their stand.
Only through a nonviolent approach can the fears of the white community be
mitigated. A guilt-ridden white minority lives in fear that if the Negro should ever attain
power, he would act without restraint or pity to revenge the injustices and brutality of the
years. It is something like a parent who continually mistreats a son. One day that parent
raises his hand to strike the son, only to discover that the son is now as tall as he is. The
parent is suddenly afraid-fearful that the son will use his new physical power to repay his
parent for all the blows of the past.
The Negro, once a helpless child, has now grown up politically, culturally, and
economically. Many white men fear retaliation. The job of the Negro is to show them that
they have nothing to fear, that the Negro understands and forgives and is ready to forget the
past. He must convince the white man that all he seeks is justice, for both himself and the
white man. A mass movement exercising nonviolence is an object lesson in power under
discipline, a demonstration to the white community that if such a movement attained a degree
of strength, it would use its power creatively and not vengefully.
Nonviolence can touch men where the law cannot reach them. When the law
regulates behavior it plays an indirect part in molding public sentiment. The enforcement of
the law is itself a form of peaceful persuasion. But the law needs help. The courts can order
desegregation of the public schools. But what can be done to mitigate the fears, to disperse
the hatred, violence, and irrationality gathered around school integration, to take the initiative
out of the hands of racial demagogues, to release respect for the law? In the end, for laws to
be obeyed, men must believe they are right.
Here nonviolence comes in as the ultimate form of persuasion. It is the method which
seeks to implement the just law by appealing to the con- science of the great decent majority
who through blindness, fear, pride, or irrationality have allowed their consciences to sleep.
The nonviolent resisters can summarize their message in the following simple terms:
We will take direct action against injustice without waiting for other agencies to act. We will
not obey unjust laws or submit to unjust practices. We will do this peacefully, openly,
cheerfully because our aim is to persuade. We adopt the means of nonviolence because our
end is a community at peace with itself. We will try to persuade with our words, but if our
words fail, we will try to persuade with our acts. We will always be willing to talk and seek
fair compromise, but we are ready to suffer when necessary and even risk our lives to
become witnesses to the truth as we see it.
The way of nonviolence means a willingness to suffer and sacrifice. It may mean
going to jail. If such is the case the resister must be willing to fill the jailhouses of the South.
It may even mean physical death. But if physical death is the price that a man must pay to
free his children and his white brethren from a permanent death of the spirit, then nothing
could be more redemptive.
